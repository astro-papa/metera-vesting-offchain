# Workflow to create a new Github package release
Here's a step-by-step guide to create a new Github package release:

- Update the code.
- Commit the changes.
- Push the changes to the develop branch Github repository.
- Check if the Continuous Integration (CI) passes. If it does, proceed to the next step. If not, address the issues before proceeding further.
- Bump the library version based on the extent of the changes made. Here are the three options to do so:
    * For a small bug fix, run: 
    ```
    pnpm version patch
    ```
    * For adding new functionality in a backward-compatible way, run: 
    ```
    pnpm version minor
    ```
    * For making breaking changes to the code, run: 
    ```
    pnpm version major
    ```
- After bumping the version, go to the Github project's releases page
- Create a new tag with the bumped version number.
- To create a new npm package in the github organization, make sure the Node.js package CI succeeds.
- If the CI Action fails, remove the release, tag, and commit the new changes. Then, push the changes and draft a new release.
